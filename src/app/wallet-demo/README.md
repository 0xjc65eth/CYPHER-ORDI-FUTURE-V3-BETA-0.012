   - Comparison between standard and premium content

## How It Works

1. The user clicks the "Connect Wallet" button in the header
2. A modal appears allowing them to select their preferred Bitcoin wallet
3. After connecting, the system automatically checks if they own any NFTs from premium collections
4. If a premium collection is found, the user sees a visual indication and gains access to premium content
5. Premium content throughout the site is wrapped in the `PremiumContent` component, which only shows the content to premium users

## Premium Collections

The following collections grant premium access:
- OCM GENESIS
- OCM KATOSHI PRIME
- OCM KATOSHI CLASSIC
- MULTIVERSO PASS
- SEIZE CTRL
- N0 0RDINARY KIND
- BITCOIN PUPPETS
- THE WIZARDS OF LORDS
- YIELD HACKER PASS
- STACK SATS

## Technical Implementation

- Uses the LaserEyes library for Bitcoin wallet integration
- Implements the `useLaserEyes` hook for wallet interactions
- Uses the `getInscriptions` method to fetch and verify NFT ownership
- Custom animations using Canvas for particle effects and confetti
- React Portal for modal rendering
- Custom event system for communicating wallet status across components
